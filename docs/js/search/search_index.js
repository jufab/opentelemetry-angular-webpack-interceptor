your Angular application\nThis library uses opentelemetry-js package and @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor\nOnly works for Angular >= 9.0.0\nMore info :

Propagator Configuration\n\n\nAngular Module\n\n\nHow it works\nExample\nRun\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemtery-collector\n\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10 Warning\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\nInstallation\nWith npm :\nnpm install @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-webpack-interceptor @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor @opentelemetry/web @opentelemetry/exporter-collector @opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger @opentelemetry/exporter-zipkinConfiguration\nUse the \"OpenTelemetryWebpackConfig\" interface to configure this extra feature (use \"OpenTelemetryConfig\" for the common config)\nexport interface OpenTelemetryWebpackConfig {\n  jaegerConfig?: JaegerCollectorConfig;\n  zipkinConfig?: ZipkinCollectorConfig;\n}Example global Configuration\nFrom the example-app\nopentelemetryConfig: {\n    commonConfig: {\n      console: true, //(boolean) Display trace on console\n      production: false, //(boolean) Send trace with BatchSpanProcessor (true) or SimpleSpanProcessor (false) more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-api#tracing\n      serviceName: 'example-app', //Service name send in trace\n      collector: Collector.otelcol, //Enum to specified the collector : OpenTelemetry Collector(otelcol), Zipkin (zipkin), Jaeger (jaeger)\n      propagator: Propagator.composite, // Enum to

 jaegerPropagatorConfig: {\n      customHeader: 'custom-header',\n    }\n  }\nCommon Configuration\n\nconsole: (boolean) Display trace on console if true\nproduction: (boolean)Send trace via BatchSpanProcessor (Async) or SimpleSpanProcessor (Sync) : It's recommend to use BatchSpanProcessor on Production.\nserviceName: (string) Service name in your trace\ncollector: (Enum) use Enum Collector (otelcol,zipkin,jaeger)\npropagator: (Enum) use Propagator Enum (b3,httpTrace,composite,jaeger)\n\nOpenTelemetry-collector Configuration\n\nurl: (string) url of opentelemetry collector (default : http://localhost:55681/v1/trace)\nheaders: list of custom header\n\nZipkin Collector Configuration\n\nurl: (string) url of zipkin collector (default :

Configuration\n\ncustomHeader: (string) custom header\n\nAngular Module\nTo insert OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule, you can add in your application module (generally app.module.ts)\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n...\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule } from '@jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor';\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    HttpClientModule,\n    //Insert module OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule with configuration, HttpClientModule is used for interceptor\n    OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule.forRoot(environment.opentelemetryConfig),\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}How it works\nExample\nThis project have an \"example-app\" as Angular application example.\nprojects/example-app\nYou can see how configure and insert this module.\nYou can althought test opentelemetry-angular-interceptor with this application.\nRun\nTo start this Example application, run command :\nnpm run start:complete-example-appand open the application at http://localhost:4200\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemtery-collector\nIf you want to see the result in a collector *, there's a docker-compose available in this project.\nYou can start it with this command :\ndocker-compose -f projects/example-app/collector/docker-compose.yaml up -dGo to the jaeger application (http://localhost:16686) to see result.\nMore info about the collector here : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector\n\n* without an Agent or a Collector you can see an error in your browser about sending a \"trace\".\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10
