\n\nOpenTelemetry Angular Webpack Interceptor\nWork In progress\n@jufab/opentelemetry-angular-webpack-interceptor is an Angular Library to deploy OpenTelemetry with Zipkin Exporter and use custom webpack in your Angular application\nThis library uses opentelemetry-js package and @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor\nOnly works for Angular >= 9.0.0\nMore info :

started\nInstallation\nConfiguration\nExample global Configuration\nCommon Configuration\nZipkin Collector Configuration\n\n\nAngular Module\n\n\nHow it works\nExample\nRun\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemtery-collector\n\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10 Warning\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\nInstallation\nWith npm :\nnpm install @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-webpack-interceptor @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor @opentelemetry/web @opentelemetry/exporter-collector @opentelemetry/exporter-zipkinAnd you need custom-webpack \nMore information about installation here\nConfiguration\nUse the \"OpenTelemetryWebpackConfig\" interface to configure this extra feature (use \"OpenTelemetryConfig\" for the common config)\nexport interface OpenTelemetryWebpackConfig {\n  zipkinConfig?: ZipkinCollectorConfig;\n}Example global Configuration\nFrom the example-app\n  openTelemetryConfig: {\n    commonConfig: {\n      console: true, // Display trace on console\n      production: false, // Send Trace with BatchSpanProcessor (true) or SimpleSpanProcessor (false)\n      serviceName: 'example-app', // Service name send in trace\n      probabilitySampler: 1 // Samples a configurable percentage of traces, value between 0 to 1\n    },\n  },\n  openTelemetryWebpackConfig: {\n    zipkinConfig: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans' // Default value: http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans\n    },\n  },\n  ...Common Configuration\n\nconsole: (boolean) Display trace on console if true\nproduction: (boolean)Send trace via BatchSpanProcessor (Async) or SimpleSpanProcessor (Sync) : It's recommend to use BatchSpanProcessor on Production.\nserviceName: (string) Service name in your trace\nprobabilitySampler: a value between 0 and 1 \n\nZipkin Collector Configuration\n\nurl: (string) url of zipkin collector (default : http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans)\n\nAngular Module\nTo insert OpentelemetryInterceptorWebpackModule, you can add in your application module (generally app.module.ts)\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n...\nimport { OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule } from '@jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor';\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    // Insert module OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule with configuration, HttpClientModule is used for interceptor\n    OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule.forRoot(environment.openTelemetryConfig),\n    // Extra configuration for OpentelemetryInterceptorWebpackModule\n    OpentelemetryInterceptorWebpackModule.forRoot(environment.openTelemetryWebpackConfig),\n    // Propagator (here, composite propagator)\n    CompositePropagatorModule,\n    // Zipkin exporter\n    ZipkinExporterModule,\n    ...\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule {}How it works\nExample\nThis project have an \"example-app\" as Angular application example.\nprojects/example-app\nYou can see how configure and insert this module.\nYou can althought test opentelemetry-angular-webpack-interceptor with this application.\nRun\nTo start this Example application, run command :\nnpm startand open the application at http://localhost:4200\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemtery-collector\nIf you want to see the result in a collector *, there's a docker-compose available in this project.\nYou can start it with this command :\ndocker-compose -f projects/example-app/collector/docker-compose.yaml up -dGo to the zipkin application (http://localhost:9412) to see result.\nMore info about the collector here : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector\n\n* without an Agent or a Collector you can see an error in your browser about sending a \"trace\".\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10 Warning\nWARNING in
